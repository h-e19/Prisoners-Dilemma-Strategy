# Prisoners-Dilemma-Strategy
This is a modified version of the Tit-for-Tat strategy that utilizes gradual increase and decrease of a sin function. 
It was implemented as a finite state machine in verilog, which I know is odd, because we were studying Digital Logic Design and wanted to do something fun that incorporated all that we learned and some interesting idea's on game theory.
The report attached is by no means a proper one, just something that jotted down the tournament results and findings.
